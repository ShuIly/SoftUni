                I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a stormtrooper.
                Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know.
                And raised to do one thing. But my first battle, I made a choice.
                I wasn't gonna kill for them. So I ran. Right into you. And you
                looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was.
                But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back.

                The Force Awakens was announced after the Walt Disney
                Company's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012.
                It was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator
                Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy.
                Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original
                trilogy films The Empire Strikes Bak (1980), rewrote
                an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams,
                composer for the previous six films, returned to compose
                the film's score.

                Lucas served as creative consultant during the film's
                early production. Filming began in April 2014 in Abu Dhabi
                and Iceland, with principal photography also taking place
                in Ireland and Pinewood Studios in England and concluded in
                November 2014. It is the first live-action film in the
                franchise since Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,
                released ten years prior in 2005.
